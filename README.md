# Fractol

42 School - Hive Helsinki - project.

This project continues the exploration of graphic programming, through the creating of a fractol program.
It uses the MLX library which can be found inside the repository. 

Fun features include multithreading, zooming to the mouse position, colour changes, and movement with the WSAD.
Multiple fractols can be found here, including Mandelbrot, Julia, (as well as the multibrot and multijulia),
Tricon, Burning Ship and Barnsley Fern.

The parameters of the Julia, multijulia as well as barnsley fern can be changed, and locked with a mouse click.
